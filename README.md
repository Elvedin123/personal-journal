# myJournal

## Project description
This project will be a data base that will save data entries that contain whatever your heart desires! Whether it was what you ate at a particular day or a cool event you attented. The main purpose of this application is to be used as a diary to store memories that you can save and always look back to. The functionality will include a form where you can input a brief title for your entry, the topic you choose to talk about, your data entry and when the event occured. In addition the user is capable of editing said entries, delete them and add new ones which will all be stored and saved in myJournal's home page (filtered by date) which provides the user easy access.
