# myJournal

## Project description
This project will be a data base that will save data entries that contain whatever your heart desires! Whether it was what you ate at a particular day or a cool event you attented. The main purpose of this application is to be used as a diary to store memories that you can save and always look back to. The functionality will include a form where you can input a brief title for your entry, the topic you choose to talk about, your data entry and when the event occured. In addition the user is capable of editing said entries, delete them and add new ones which will all be stored and saved in myJournal's home page (filtered by date) which provides the user easy access.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

- I enjoy the orginization of react and being able to utilize multiple components that can be imported to the main app.
- I like the usage of link and router making access to components clean and efficient
- My biggest strength is my work drive, I don't know how to give up and will push forward to understand implimentations of code.
### Weaknesses:

- I am still struggling to grasp react efficiently and always have to look back at notes, google, and peer help to understand issues.
- Since i dont give up i usually end up extremely frustrated when i dont find a solution. Which burns me out ultimately.

### Opportunities:

- This project gives me an opportunity to use react to build an application in my own way.
- This also gives me ideas to create dynamic projects using external api and not airtable.
- Lastly im looking forward to implementing proper npm packages that can clean up my application and make it look according to plan.

### Threats:

- My biggest threat is my mental game, since i do struggle with react in the mean time i am worried that i will burn myself out on roadblocks
- Being new to utilizing npm packages im concerened that i can potentially mess up and need to use a basic alternative which will take time
